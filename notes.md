> Explain the company or investment fund, its investment activities, and the people involved.

The Bear Stearns Companies was a NY based global investment bank founded in 1923. Prior to the financial collapse, Bear Stearns was the fifth-largest investment bank in the world, with $18 billion in assets. It was a highly respected amongst the investment banks in the Wall st ([Chen](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear-stearns.asp), 2021). Bear Stearns had two hedge funds, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Fund and the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund, among the wide range of financial services they provided. Those two hedge funds are the reason why they had to file for bankruptcy.

> When and how did the failure occur, and what happened?

The fall down of the Bear Stearns occurred as one of the major events in the 2007 to 2008 global financial crisis, and they are one of the investment banks that went bankrupt as a result of it.

### What is a CDO?
Their hedge funds heavily used enhanced leverage to profit from collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).

- Commercial banks lend money to those who wants to buy a house. That is a loan
- Commercial banks will sell that loan and right for the house in the case of defaulting to investment banks (Commercial banks will benefit from service fees and such)
- Investment banks are not interested in servicing the fees and they will create a special purpose entity that holds the loan.
- That SPE will start selling shares which in a sense splits the loan payment by the number of shares and those shareholders will have the right for the property when the loan defaults (This is why such shares are called mortgage backed securities)
- And those shares were part of the CDO asset pool
- If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, the lowest prioritizes tranches suffer losses first.

> What aspects of good investment or risk management practice were violated?

The strategy works well when credit markets remain stable or behavior is predictable from the historical data. However, the housing crisis caused the mortgage-backed securities market to behave in a manner that was well outside of what the portfolio managers had imangined. In short, they failed to count in the extreme cases.
When the housing market, which was soaring until then, started to plummet in April 2007. The investment bank rapidly realized that the true danger posed by these hedge fund techniques was far higher than initially thought.
Overall, mistakes of Bear Stearns' hedge fund managers were: failing to accurately predict how the market of their assets would behave under extreme circumstances, not having enough liquid assets to cover debts in such cases, and leveraged too much ([Tardi](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/bear-stearns-collapse.asp), 2021).


> How was the failure resolved?

With insufficient liquid asset, Bear Stearns approached the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a cash loan of $25 billion. Initially, FRBNY agreed to provide a $25 billion loan to Bear Stearns. However, they changed their mind and when the request was denied, JPMorgan Chase agreed to buy Bear Stearns for $2 a share, with the Fed guaranteeing $30 billion in MBS. The final price was ultimately raised to $10 a share, but that was still much less compared to the price of $170 a year earlier ([The Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/bear-stearns-collapse.asp
), 2021).

> Explain the lessons from this failure for portfolio managers, investors or clients, and regulators.

One lesson from the collapse is that they should always hedge risks even for extreme cases. Also, they put put too much eggs in one basket. CDO would have been diverse but in reality, it was heavily mortgage based securities, which was not diverse enough.
